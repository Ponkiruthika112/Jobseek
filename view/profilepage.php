<p><h2>6 Simple Personality Development Tips for Freshers</h2>
<br>
Personality development is a crucial aspect for anyone who wants to succeed. Now that college is over, so are the days of spontaneous interactions and friendly debates with your classmates and professors. Interactions within the professional domain are vastly different in terms of how you speak, behave and even dress. But fret not, for we have gathered some helpful interview tips for those seeking fresher jobs. It’s time to drop the casual shorts and put on formal trousers – but not always, as you’ll find out below. 
<br>
Here are 6 areas for personality development tips that freshers must work on before interviews: 
<br><li>
Eye contact</li>
<li>Verbal communication</li> 
<li>Face-to-face round </li>
<li>Crossed arms and legs </li>
<li>Posture</li> 
<li>Dress code</li></p><br><br>
<p>
The irony of job search advice: There’s so much available that you don’t have to spend more than four seconds Googling before you land on some nugget of wisdom or another.
<br><br>
Yet, at the same time, there’s so much available (some of which completely contradicts other advice you’ll find) that it can easily overwhelm you. Which, in fact, is probably the exact opposite outcome you’re looking for when you go sleuthing for genuinely useful counsel in the first place.
<br><br>
So let’s do this: Let’s boil things down to a short list of sound, timeless job searching tips that’ll help you fine-tune your strategy so that you may sail through the process (or at least cut out some of the unnecessary time and frustration). 
<br>
<br>

<h3>1. Make Yourself a “Smack-in-the-Forehead” Obvious Fit</h3>
When you apply for a job via an online application process, it’s very likely that your resume will first be screened by an applicant tracking system and then (assuming you make this first cut) move onto human eyeballs. The first human eyeballs that review your resume are often those of a lower level HR person or recruiter, who may or may not understand all of the nuances of that job for which you’re applying.
<br>
<br>
Thus, it behooves you to make it very simple for both the computer and the human to quickly connect their “Here’s what we’re looking for” to your “Here’s what you can walk through our doors and deliver.”
<br>
<br>


<h3>Tip</h3><br>
Study the job description and any available information you have on the position. Are you mirroring the words and phrases in the job description? Are you showcasing your strengths in the areas that seem to be of paramount importance to this role? Line it up. Line it up.
<br>
<br>


<h3>2. Don’t Limit Yourself to Online Applications During Your Job Search</h3>
You want that job search to last and last? Well, then continue to rely solely on submitting online applications. You want to accelerate this bad boy? Don’t stop once you apply online for that position. Start finding and then endearing yourself to people working at that company of interest. Schedule informational interviews with would-be peers. Approach an internal recruiter and ask a few questions. Get on the radar of the very people who might influence you getting an interview. (More on that here.)

<br>
<br>

<h3>Tip</h3>
By lining up with people on the inside of the companies at which you want to work, you will instantly set yourself apart. Decision makers interview people who come recommended or by way of a personal referral before they start sorting through the blob of resumes that arrives by way of the ATS.
<br>
<br>


<h3>3. Remember That Your Resume (and LinkedIn Profile) Is Not a Tattoo</h3><br>
Yes, your new resume is lovely. Your LinkedIn profile, breathtaking. However, if they don’t position you as a direct match for a particular role that you’re gunning for, don’t be afraid to modify wording, switch around key terms, and swap bullet points in and out. Your resume is not a tattoo, nor is your LinkedIn profile. Treat them as living, breathing documents throughout your job search (and career).

<br>
<br>

<h3>Tip</h3>
<br>
If you’re a covert job seeker, remember to turn off your activity broadcasts (within privacy and settings) when you make edits to your LinkedIn profile. If your current boss or colleagues are connected to you on LinkedIn, they may get suspicious about all the frequent changes.

<br>
<br>



<h3>4. Accept That You Will Never Bore Anyone Into Hiring You</h3><br>
<br>
Don’t get me wrong—you absolutely must come across as polished, articulate, and professional throughout your job search. However, many people translate this into: Must. Be. Boring.
<br>
<br>
Wrong, wrong, wrong. Realize that few people get hired because they had perfect white space on their cover letters, memorized all of the “correct” interview questions or used incredibly safe, common phraseology (i.e., clichés) throughout their resumes. All of this correctness is going to make you look staged and non-genuine. Instead, give yourself permission to be both polished and endearing. Memorable, likable candidates are almost always the ones who go the distance.
